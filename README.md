Project Setup
==

Ahead of time, you should install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), and
[lineman.js](http://linemanjs.com/):

We'll be using Node.js and Lineman.js as a simple way to serve our Backbone.js
application throughout the workshop. While you need to have them installed, we
will not be covering them in detail during the workshop.

- Install Node.js
  - Mac users: `brew install node`
  - Windows users: [download and install node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/)
- Install Lineman: `npm install -g lineman`
- Start the server: `lineman run`
- Check that things are working by visiting http://localhost:8000
